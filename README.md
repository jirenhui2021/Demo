# Demo
We provide audio demo of <PMVC:Data Augmentation-Based Prosody Modeling for Expressive Voice Conversion> in this project.

# Folders 
## RR and RP
There are some samples of augmented speech from Random Resampling and Random Prosody (proposed) strategy respectively.

`/SSB0005` provides source speech of speaker SSB0005.

`/SSB0005_RR` provides augmented speech based on RR.

`/SSB0005_RP` provides augmented speech based on RP.
